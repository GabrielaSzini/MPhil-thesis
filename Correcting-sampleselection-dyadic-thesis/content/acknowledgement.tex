\section*{Acknowledgements}

I am extremely greatful to my supervisor Professor Frank Kleibergen. Not only he helped me a lot in shaping my agenda for this thesis, while still allowing me to follow my interests, but he was also extremely patient with me throughout this process. I can definitely say that I learned a lot from him.

I would like to thank my parents, Rosane and Alexander Szini, and my grandparents, Marilene and Missao Miyazato, for the unconditional support they have always provided me since I was a child. Without their support I would not be able to be here at the Tinbergen Institute today. I am also greatful for Roberto Padovani and Professor Vladimir Ponczek for having incentivized me to pursue an academic career since my bachelor days.

I truly appreciate all the comments about this study and my earlier drafts made by Anna Buijsman, Timo Schenk, Mariia Artemova, Julius Il\u{c}iukas, Carlos Lopes and Paloma Assun\c{c}\~{a}o. Finally, I would like to thank all my colleagues at TI that made this journey more fun.
